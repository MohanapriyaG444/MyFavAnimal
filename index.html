        <p>The lion has a long body, short legs, sharp claws, and a large head. Adult males are about 9 to 10 feet (2.7 to 3 meters) long, including the tail. 
            They stand about 3 feet (1 meter) tall at the shoulder and can weigh 370 to 500 pounds (170 to 230 kilograms). 
            Females are shorter and more slender.Lions are covered with yellow-brown hair. A male lion is easy to spot because of its mane.
             This coarse hair grows on its head, neck, and shoulders. Lionesses (females) do not have manes.</p>
